Installation
-------------------------
With Chrome you can no longer download and run the script. So in Chrome you must open up the Extensions window (in latest version of Chrome click on the 3 bar icon in the top right corner of the browser, going to Tools, then Extensions) and then you must drag this javascript file into the Extensions window. A smaller rectangle will show up with the words, "Drop to install." Do as it says.
